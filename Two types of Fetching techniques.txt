Two types of Fetching techniques
--------------------------------------------
1).Lazy(By Default)
Example: In an ORM framework like Hibernate in Java, lazy loading might be used for fetching related entities only when they are accessed through lazy-loaded associations.
2).Eager 
if you want use the Eager means.
Explicitly add @OneToMany(fetch=FetchType.EAGER)

Example: In the context of a database query, eager fetching could involve using JOIN statements to retrieve all related data in a single query rather than making separate queries for each piece of related data.

In summary, lazy fetching defers data loading until it is specifically requested, while eager fetching loads all necessary data immediately.
